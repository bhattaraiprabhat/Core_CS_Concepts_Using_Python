In python mutable array is defined in "list" and immutable array are defined
in "tuple". "Dictionary" and "set" are another array like data structures that are very
useful in some kind of data structure handling.

These data structures are rich in features. They have number of functions and
operations. So, I will discuss only some of the functions.
